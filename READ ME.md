Hi! thanks for downloading my minecraft world c:
this is a quick little guide in case you don't know how to add it your worlds!

1) Extract the zip folder you downloaded! 
2) Once you've done that, move the extracted folder into the "saves" folder from your .minecraft folder.

the saves folder's directory is usually> [ C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves ]

and that's it! you'll have acess to the world! ^^ yippee!
keep in mind the world is built in 1.20.1, so older minecraft versions might not work/will mess up your file
(datapacks are specifically set to 1.20.1)
